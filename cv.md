### Briefly About Myself
As a teenager, I had a CD with a course in HTML and CSS. Having passed them, I received sufficient knowledge to create a website for the school museum.

After leaving school, despite the fact that my specialty was not related to programming, I continued to administer several sites, understanding JavaScrpt, Ruby and Joomla on my own. In the same years, I became interested in studying Adobe products (Illustrator, Photoshop, Premier Pro).

After graduation, he worked as a teacher of various disciplines, including computer science. In parallel with teaching, he combined the position of a programmer, administering the website of the educational institution.

Every year we have to make more and more efforts to keep up with new trends in the creation of information products. But I don't give up!
